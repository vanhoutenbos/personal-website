## Configuration Steps

### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

2. **Get Google Search Console verification**:
   - Visit https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Add your property
   - Choose HTML tag method
   - Copy just the `content` value

3. **Update _config.yml**:
   ```yaml
   # Add these lines to _config.yml
   google_analytics_id: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"  # Replace with your actual ID
   google_site_verification: "your_verification_code"  # Replace with your code
   ```

4. **Commit and deploy**:

   git add _config.yml
   git commit -m "Configure Google Analytics and Search Console"
   git push
   ```

5. **Verify in Google Search Console**:
   - Wait a few minutes for the site to deploy
   - Click "Verify" in Google Search Console
   - Submit your sitemap: `https://www.jeanpaulvanhouten.nl/sitemap.xml`

## Privacy Considerations

The Google Analytics implementation includes:

You may want to add a cookie consent banner or privacy policy page to comply with GDPR/CCPA requirements.
